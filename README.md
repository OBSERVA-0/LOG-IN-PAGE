```markdown
This project is a secure user management system built with Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, featuring functionality for user registration, login, and password reset.
It employs bcrypt for password hashing to ensure security, with MongoDB serving as the database for storing user credentials and login attempt tracking.
RESTful APIs handle HTTPS POST methods for secure data exchange, with robust error handling and validation implemented throughout.
The modular backend design ensures maintainability, while features like input sanitization and database integration provide a reliable and scalable solution for user authentication and management.
